# Hobo's Nerdy Configs

This is my current setup for my personal linux devices, not including my servers. 

## Quick Installers

### Fedora

My main distro is Fedora 42. This should work, and is the most up to date on my setup.

- [Fedora 42](fedora-install.md)


### Others

These were installers that worked at one point in time. These are not up to date with my current setup, and will likely be archived soon.

- [MacOS](mac-install.md)
- [Arch Linux](arch-install.md)


### My Setup Explained

I have recently moved away from cool and sexy to minimal and practical. I dont have the ability to copy my configs to all the servers I administrate, and its also a security risk to be using so many unverified packages.

I have limited COPR/3rd party packages to a minimum, and have done my best to carefully review each one that I enable. I would suggest you do the same in your setup, and see how base level you can make your setup without adding in so many insecure bells and whistles.
